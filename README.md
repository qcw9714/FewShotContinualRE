Requirements
==========

The model is implemented using PyTorch. The versions of packages used are shown below.


*	numpy==1.18.0

*	scikit-learn==0.22.1

*	scipy==1.4.1

*	torch==1.3.0

*	tqdm==4.41.1



Baselines
==========

The main experimental settings come from the project [Lifelong Relation Detection](https://github.com/hongwang600/ Lifelong_Relation_Detection).

We adapt some typical lifelong learning methods for continual relation learning, including EMR, AGEM and EWC. The code of these models can be found in the folder "./baseline/".



Datasets
==========

We provide all the datasets and word embeddings used in our experiments.

Run the experiments
==========

#### (0) To run the experiments, unpack the datasets and word embeddings first

```
unzip data.zip -d data/
unzip glove.zip -d glove/
```

#### (1) For FewRel

```
cp -r data/ fewrel/
cp -r glove/ fewrel/
cd fewrel
python run_multi_proto.py
```

#### (2) For SimpleQuestions

```
cp -r data/ simque/
cp -r glove/ simque/
cd simque
python run_multi_proto.py
```

#### (3) For TACRED

```
cp -r data/ tacred/
cp -r glove/ tacred/
cd tacred
python run_multi_proto.py
```

#### (4) For some special settings

All the config files can be found in "./fewrel/config/", "./tacred/config/", and  "./simque/config/". By changing the config file name in the code "run\_multi\_proto.py", we can run experiments with different settings. In "./fewrel/config/", "./tacred/config/", and  "./simque/config/", we also provide code to generate customized settings.
